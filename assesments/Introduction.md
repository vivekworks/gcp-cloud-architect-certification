## Introduction

1. Building for Builders LLC manufactures equipment used in residential and commercial building. Each of its 500,000 pieces of equipment in use around the globe has IoT devices collecting data about the state of equipment. The IoT data is streamed from each device every 10 seconds. On average, 10 KB of data is sent in each message. The data will be used for predictive maintenance and product development. The company would like to use a managed service in Google Cloud. What would you recommend?

    - Apache Cassandra
    - Cloud Bigtable
    - BigQuery
    - Cloud SQL

        Option B is correct. Bigtable is the best option for streaming IoT data, since it supports low-latency writes and is designed to scale to support petabytes of data. Option A is incorrect because Apache Cassandra is not a managed database in GCP. Option C is incorrect because BigQuery is a data warehouse. While it is a good option for analyzing large volumes of data, Bigtable is a better option for ingesting the data. Option D is incorrect. CloudSQL is a managed relational database. The use case does not require a relational database, and Bigtable's scalability is a better fit with the requirements.

2. You have developed a web application that is becoming widely used. The front end runs in Google App Engine and scales automatically. The backend runs on Compute Engine in a managed instance group. You have set the maximum number of instances in the backend managed instance group to five. You do not want to increase the maximum size of the managed instance group or change the VM instance type, but there are times the front end sends more data than the backend can keep up with and data is lost. What can you do to prevent the loss of data?

- Use an unmanaged instance group.
- Store ingested data in Cloud Storage.
- Have the front end write data to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, and have the backend read from that topic.
- Store ingested data in BigQuery.

        <summary>Click for Correct Answer</summary>
        The correct answer is C. A Cloud Pub/Sub topic would decouple the front end and backend, provide a managed and scalable message queue, and store ingested data until the backend can process it. Option A is incorrect. Switching to an unmanaged instance group will mean that the instance group cannot autoscale. Option B is incorrect. You could store ingested data in Cloud Storage, but it would not be as performant as the Cloud Pub/Sub solution. Option D is incorrect because BigQuery is a data warehouse and not designed for this use case.

You are setting up a cloud project and want to assign members of your team different roles that have appropriate permissions for their responsibilities. What GCP service would you use to do that?

- Cloud Identity
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Cloud Authorizations
- LDAP

    <details>
        <summary>Click for Correct Answer</summary>
        The correct answer is B. IAM is used to manage roles and permissions. Option A is incorrect. Cloud Identity is a service for creating and managing identities. Option C is incorrect. There is no GCP service with that name at this time. Option D is incorrect. LDAP is not a GCP service.

You would like to run a custom stateless container in a managed Google Cloud service. What are your three options?

- App Engine Standard, Cloud Run, and Kubernetes Engine
- App Engine Flexible, Cloud Run, and Kubernetes Engine
- Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, and Kubernetes Engine
- Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and App Engine Flexible

    <details>
        <summary>Click for Correct Answer</summary>
        The correct answer is B. You can run custom stateless containers in App Engine Flexible, Cloud Run, and Kubernetes Engine. Option A is incorrect because App Engine Standard does not support custom containers. Option C is incorrect because Compute Engine is not a managed service and Cloud Functions does not support custom containers. Option D is incorrect because Cloud Functions does not support custom containers.

PhotosForYouToday prints photographs and ships them to customers. The front-end application uploads photos to Cloud Storage. Currently, the back end runs a cron job that checks Cloud Storage buckets every 10 minutes for new photos. The product manager would like to process the photos as soon as they are uploaded. What would you use to cause processing to start when a photo file is saved to Cloud Storage?
A Cloud Function
An App Engine Flexible application
A Kubernetes pod
A cron job that checks the bucket more frequently
